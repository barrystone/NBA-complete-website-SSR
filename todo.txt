 // Debugging 
    usedispatch(hook) in getStaticProps() won't work, i still finding the solution..

    try mapStateToProp ==> stil don't know how to use that function(action) in getStaticToProps(), no way

    above problem may not solve...

    recommend to use
    next-redux-wrapper

    ----

    why store/standing.js
    getStandings custom action
    cann't show the type name in redux dev tool (undefined) 

    ----
    pages/standings/index.js show some problem for redux applying, reload the page and data will show (useEfect),
    and oposite not (router loading)?

    pages/standings/[title].js not apply redux yet.
